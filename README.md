# simple php project

- In this repository, the implementation of a very simple online store is discussed.
- Obviously, I have no expertise in web development, especially with php language, but I was very surprised while working on this project, while it is simple to work with, it is very efficient.
- The front and back of this website does not follow web development architectures at all and it just works!!!
- This project is the final project of the "Specialized workshop in field 4" course.
